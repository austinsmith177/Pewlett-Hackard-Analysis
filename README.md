**Purpose**
- The purpose is to help determine the number of retiring employees with a given job title, within the date range of January, 1 1952 and December 31, 1955. 

**Results**
- I created a retirement_tittles table that shows us the count of every position and how many are retiring.
- I also found how many people are eligible for mentorship between January 1, 1965 and December 31, 1965.

**Conclusion**
- Based on the gathered information, it is easy to tell that a majority of their workers will be retiring within the next few years. This will create many job openings and bring in new people with fresh eyes and experience.
